# MTA-Analysis-Project

First Project done at Metis! In groups, we looked at MTA subway data to determine the best times and stations to target people for a fictional fundraising gala. This involved a lot of cleaning data, visualizing and analyzing it in different ways, and making assumptions about which groups of people would be most willing to give email information to our canvassers.
